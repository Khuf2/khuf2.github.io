# khuf2.github.io
Personal website to showcase various art compositions I've made over the last year or so. Made with HTML, CSS, and JS.
The home page is index.html. 
All the .html files provided are pages of the website. 
The CSS styling files are found in the styles folder, and currently the main stylesheet is sticky.css. 
The JS files are found in the JavaScript folder, consisting of Lightbox plugins and sticky navbar enabling functions. 
The images that are found in all the art pages are found in the galleryImages folder, and each work of art has a thumbnail image and a full-size.
